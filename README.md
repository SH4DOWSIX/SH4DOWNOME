## Quick Start Guide
- If you're a first time user, nothing saves, so create a new piece if you want to recall stuff. (You can have as many pieces as you want and as many sections as you want.)
- If you're upgrading to a newer version, move the preset.json file from the old folder to the new folder.
- You can turn off the window (OBS Beat) in the settings of the metronome, it's default to show upon first use.
- Start/Stop the Metronome with the space bar.
- Change sections with Arrow Keys.
- Move sections with CTRL + Arrow Up and Down Keys.
- Rename Sections by double clicking the label text.
- To change Time Signature and Subdivision, click the icons/text that's below the section area, they're to the left of the tempo spin box/above the the tempo slider.
- The rest should be pretty self explanatory.

## Known Issues

- Accents not saving.
